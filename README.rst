README for sinarngo.pressroom
=============================

Press Room is a simple add-on product which can be used to easily manage
an online Press Room within your Plone site.  It adds 4 new content
types to your Plone site including a Press Release, a Press Clip (i.e.
an outside news piece), and a Press Contact (someone who might be
available to speak to the press.)

It also provides a Press Room, a folderish content type with a nice
default view and some automatically created folders and Collections (aka
Smart Folders) to help you organize and present your press materials.

NGOs and other organizations need this feature, as a press release is
different from "News".
